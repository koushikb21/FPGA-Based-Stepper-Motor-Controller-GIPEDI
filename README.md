# FPGA-Based Stepper Motor Controller (GIPEDI Internship, IIT Delhi)

This repository contains the Verilog-based implementation of a **precision FPGA-based stepper motor controller**, developed during the GIPEDI internship at **IIT Delhi (15 May– 15 July 2025)**.
Custom A4988 Carrier PCB KiCad files are also included.
-----

## Overview

The project controls a **NEMA17 stepper motor** via an **A4988 microstepping driver**, using Verilog HDL on a **Xilinx Spartan-3 (XC3S200-FT256)** FPGA. It achieves **1/16 microstepping**, delivering **0.1125° per step** resolution with deterministic, real-time control.
Custom A4988 Carrier PCB KiCad files are also included.

## Features

  - FPGA-based control using **Verilog HDL**
  - **Clock Divider** module for precise STEP signal generation
  - **Motor Driver module** interfacing FPGA with A4988
  - Achieves **1/16 microstepping (0.1125° resolution)**
  - Verified with **testbench simulation, synthesis, and logic analyzer**
  - Designed **PCB schematic & layout** for hardware implementation
  - Deterministic control superior to microcontroller-based solutions

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koushikb21/FPGA-Based-Stepper-Motor-Controller-GIPEDI-.git
    ```

2.  Extract the contents of `A4988_V2.zip` (if needed for board/interface files).

3.  Open the project in **Xilinx ISE** (or use iVerilog for simulation).

4.  Run simulation with iVerilog + GTKWave:

    ```bash
    iverilog -o tb.vvp stepper_motor_driver_tb.v clock_div.v stepper_motor_driver.v
    vvp tb.vvp
    gtkwave dump.vcd
    ```

5.  Connect FPGA → A4988 → NEMA17 setup, program the FPGA, and verify stepper motor movement.

## Results

  * Achieved **0.1125° angular resolution** with 1/16 microstepping.
  * Verified **STEP/DIR signal integrity** via testbench and logic analyzer.
  * Demonstrated **deterministic, real-time motor control** compared to microcontrollers.

-----

## Future Work

  * Extend to **linear actuator system** with lead screw.
  * Add **custom softcore processor** for user interfacing.
  * Implement **continuous/single-stepping modes**.
