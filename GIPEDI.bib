Proposed driver built on a Spartan3 FPGA (XC3S400 core) development board from Xilinx. Implementation of driver realized by an FPGA and using Verilog hardware description language in the Xilinx ISE environment. The driver’s control behavior can be adapted just by altering Verilog scripts. In addition, a linear motion system developed (with 4 mm movement per motor revolution) and coupled it to the stepper motor. The performance of the driver is tested by measuring the distance traveled on linear motion system. The experimental results verified using hardware-in-loop Matlab and Xilinx cosimulation method. This driver accomplishes a firm and accurate control and is responsive.},

Therefore, designing multipliers that are high speed, low power and less area of substantial research interest. Many attempts have been made to reduce the number of partial products generated by multiplication process. The aim of this paper is to Implement a Multiplier block using shift and Add technique of multiplication in an FPGA. The implementation is done by using Xilinx 14.5 version of VHDL with the targeted device of Spartan 3E. The performance of Multiplier unit is evaluated for various parallel prefix adder variants, which are developed for high speed addition. The experimental results shows that the implemented Multiplier using hybrid parallel prefix adder is efficient in area, consume low power and high speed compared to existing parallel prefix adder models.},
